# Getting Ahead

The Getting Ahead program is a 14 week program where individuals explore the theory of change while investigating their lives and their community. Participants develop a plan to build a path out of poverty, after exploring the mental models of economic class. Individuals must commit to attending the 2-hour classes and are provided with a $25 gift certificate for each class as a way to recognize participants for their engagement and work in their individual and community investigation. For each class transportation, dinner, and child care are provided. The class is free.

A [national study](https://www.ahaprocess.com/national-study-validates-effectiveness-of-getting-ahead-program) has validated the effectiveness of the Getting Ahead program for participants from poverty. The program resulted in positive psychosocial changes, empowering individuals to overcome obstacles that hinder their escape from poverty.
