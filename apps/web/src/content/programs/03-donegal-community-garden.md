# Donegal Community Garden

The Donegal PowerPacks project partners with eligible families to provide weekly meals and nutrition education so that families are empowered and children thrive. Every week, a food bag is available for registered families that contains a recipe, ingredients and a few staple items. The project also provides information on nutrition, food budgeting and shopping strategies to help families stretch their budget. Power Packs assures that children return to school, well-fed and ready to learn.
