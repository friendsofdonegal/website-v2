# Donegal Community Gardens

Since its inception in a Getting Ahead class in 2022, the Donegal Community Gardens has evolved from a mere concept to a flourishing community initiative. Initially launched at Florin Church of the Brethren, the gardens provided a personal plot to five dedicated community members.

By the summer of 2023, the project expanded to include a second location at Mount Joy Mennonite Church. This new site focused on growing bulk produce such as potatoes and green beans, significantly benefiting the Donegal Power Packs program, which assists local families in need.

Looking forward to 2024, Donegal Community Gardens is set to grow even further, thanks to the generous donation of 3.6 acres by Donegal Presbyterian Church. This new land will enhance our capacity to cultivate a wider variety of vegetables, fostering greater community engagement and support.

## WANT TO GET INVOLVED? HERE'S HOW

* Donations: PayPal through the Friends of Donegal website.
* Volunteer: for the gardens, Power Packs, or Getting Ahead.
* Commit to a garden space.
