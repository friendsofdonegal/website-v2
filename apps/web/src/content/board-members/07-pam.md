My name is Pam Eckman, I am the third of four children (older brother & sister and younger sister). I've lived in Lancaster County all of my life. Over the years I have gone to Lancaster Bible college, helped grow, design & lead lay counselor, women's & youth ministries. This year I was certified to be a co-investigator for Getting Ahead. I have owned my own businesses and done many other occupations. I am excited to meet and serve with you on the FOD board!
