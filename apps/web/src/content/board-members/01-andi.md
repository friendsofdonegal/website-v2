Andi graduated from Lancaster General School of Nursing and from Lebanon Valley College with an MBA. Andi recently retired after a 40+ year career in nursing where she held various positions at the bedside and in administration at Lancaster General Hospital. I was born and raised in Mount Joy and graduated from Donegal High School. My parents and grandparents lived in Mount Joy. I have a passion for those who are under resourced and am actively pursuing ways for our community to help our neighbors investigate their circumstances and change their lives.
